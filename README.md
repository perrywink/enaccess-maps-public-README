# enaccess-maps
## Who we are looking for
Capable developers who can sink a significant amount of time and effort each week on the app who is:
- Proficient in React Native (Expo) or React (in which case you will have to do some learning for RN)
- Familiar with Firebase and Firebase Functions
- Familiar with React Testing using JEST and React Testing Library
- Continuously and proactively communicates problems experienced and progress throughout the week.

## What there is left to do
At the time of writing this `README`, the app is at its first MVP version, with basic functionality like 
- email auth and guest login,
- exploring nearby restaurants with an autocomplete search, viewing their accessibility information (written by other users).
- writing their own reviews. 

This version of the app has no been uploaded to either app store yet.
- Identity verification is a current blocker for publishing on the Google Play Store. This is in progress as I am in contact with Google Play Support to attempt to solve the problem. If you wish, you could take over this issue.
  - Testing on a local apk build works great. 
  - Therefore, the `abb` release currently uploaded to the Google Play account is just pending release purely due to id verification complications mentioned.
- IOS deployment has not been touched. Contact Sabrina about the 99 USD Apple developer subscription.
- The app is published on the Expo App Store and works well for Android. Unfortunately, there are issues for using it on Expo on iOS that I have not been able to debug :(

Missing features include:
- Uploading pictures alongside the reviews.
- Displaying the ratings in the pins on the map (Contact Sabrina about if she still wants this feature)
- Filtering restaurants according to the accessibility criteria.
- Additional monetization efforts via ads or some subscription (for additional features like dark mode etc). This is lower priority.

## Extra important info
- Contact Isaac about credentials (so I can securely email them to you) for the Gmail (`enaccess.developer@gmail.com`) access as well as all associated account such as:
  - Google Play Console developer (You can add your own email as a developer for ease.) 
  - The Firebase project (same deal, add yourself as a contributor.)
- Have fun with the project ðŸ˜„
